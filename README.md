# Thermostat-with-hysteresis
This circuit is a thermostat with hysteresis, using an LM741 op-amp as a comparator with an NTC thermistor for temperature sensing, adjustable setpoint and hysteresis control, and a transistor driver to operate a relay or other load while ensuring stable switching without chattering.
